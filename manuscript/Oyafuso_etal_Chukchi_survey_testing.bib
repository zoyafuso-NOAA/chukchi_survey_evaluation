Several SCUBA dives were made to observe and measure the modified trawl while being towed. Additionally, an underwater camera system was used to observe footrope contact with the bottom at varying amounts of scope ratio on several bottom types including pure sand, mixed sand with emergent biotic structure, sand with shell fragments, mud with shell fragments, and gravel and shell bedforms. Net modification tests were followed by field collections at 55 stations in which 49 species of fish were captured. The modified beam trawl appears to be an effective tool for sampling demersal fishes in a variety of habitats, including those with emergent biotic structure.}

The objective of this paper is to assess selected variance estimation methods and evaluate the influence of spatial structure on the results. These methods are treated as models and a complete enumeration of Norway was used as the modeling environment. The paper demonstrates that the advantage of systematic sampling is closely related to autocorrelation in the material, but also that the improvement is influenced by periodicity and drift in the variables. Variance estimation by stratification with the smallest possible strata gave the best overall results but may underestimate the variance when spatial autocorrelation is absent. Treating the sample as a simple random sample is a safe and conservative alternative when spatial autocorrelation is absent or unknown.}

abstract = {Abstract Projecting the future distributions of commercially and ecologically important species has become a critical approach for ecosystem managers to strategically anticipate change, but large uncertainties in projections limit climate adaptation planning. Although distribution projections are primarily used to understand the scope of potential change—rather than accurately predict specific outcomes—it is nonetheless essential to understand where and why projections can give implausible results and to identify which processes contribute to uncertainty. Here, we use a series of simulated species distributions, an ensemble of 252 species distribution models, and an ensemble of three regional ocean climate projections, to isolate the influences of uncertainty from earth system model spread and from ecological modeling. The simulations encompass marine species with different functional traits and ecological preferences to more broadly address resource manager and fishery stakeholder needs, and provide a simulated true state with which to evaluate projections. We present our results relative to the degree of environmental extrapolation from historical conditions, which helps facilitate interpretation by ecological modelers working in diverse systems. We found uncertainty associated with species distribution models can exceed uncertainty generated from diverging earth system models (up to 70\% of total uncertainty by 2100), and that this result was consistent across species traits. Species distribution model uncertainty increased through time and was primarily related to the degree to which models extrapolated into novel environmental conditions but moderated by how well models captured the underlying dynamics driving species distributions. The predictive power of simulated species distribution models remained relatively high in the first 30 years of projections, in alignment with the time period in which stakeholders make strategic decisions based on climate information. By understanding sources of uncertainty, and how they change at different forecast horizons, we provide recommendations for projecting species distribution models under global climate change.},

@article{Emelin2022,
   abstract = {Presented here are data on the size composition and age structure, the sex ratio, the state of maturity of the gonads, and the composition of the diet and feeding habits of walleye pollock in the western Chukchi Sea, based on 2003-2020 bottom and mid-water trawl surveys conducted onboard Russian research vessels. During all years of research, mid-water trawl catches in this area were dominated by juveniles with FL 5–12 cm, while the size composition of walleye pollock in bottom trawl catches was bimodal with the dominance of fish 7–14 cm and 50–62 cm long. Females were considerably larger than males (on average by almost 10 cm), with mean FL 56.0–58.3 cm and 52.1–56.4 cm, respectively, in different years. The age structure of walleye pollock was significantly different from that of both the western and eastern Bering Sea since fingerlings and yearlings predominated there in the mid-water trawl catches, and fish under the age of 1 year and 6–17 years were the most numerous in the bottom trawl catches. In the western Chukchi Sea in 2018–2020, the proportion of females in bottom trawl catches ranged from 1.8 to 2.7 females per male. This is probably because walleye pollock here were represented mainly by large fish, while in the mature part of the population, females are usually larger than males. The proportion of fish with gonads at different stages of maturity varied significantly in different years. Immature individuals were extremely few among the fish analyzed. Individuals with developing and post-spawning gonads accounted for a major part of the catches. In recent years, walleye pollock of both sexes have been observed in pre-spawning, spawning, and post-spawning condition, which may indicate the possibility of spawning of individual specimens in the western Chukchi Sea. The survival of eggs, larvae, and fry in conditions of low temperatures is unlikely. However, if the warming in the Arctic continues, it is possible that new walleye pollock spawning grounds may appear in the Chukchi Sea. In the western Chukchi Sea, the proportion of euphausiids in the diet of large walleye pollock (>40 cm in 2018 and > 60 cm in 2019) was significantly higher than that of small fish (<40 cm). In the average long-term plan, the decrease in its diet with the growth was characteristic only for planktonic organisms (small crustaceans, chaetognaths, and larvaceans). Only large benthic crustaceans showed an increase in the walleye pollock diet as it grew. There were no pronounced trends regarding euphausiids and fish. In the western Chukchi Sea, the cannibalism was registered only in large individuals (40–60 cm and >60 cm) and only in 2019 with small number juveniles consumed. Such a low level of cannibalism was probably due to the spatial separation of juveniles and adults, as well as the presence of a sufficient amount of other prey.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Based on the results of research in 1995–2020, mass and potentially commercial fish species have been identified in Russian waters of the Chukchi Sea. Among the 72 species recorded in trawl catches, 16 species from six families were mass species; fishes of the cod family (Gadidae) were absolutely dominant among them (on average, 92.6% of the total commercial biomass of marine fishes). In the late 1990s–early 2000s, the stocks of this family were represented mainly by polar cod Boreogadus saida. In the late 2010s, its biomass significantly decreased; however, the stocks of Walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) significantly increased as a result of its migrations from the northern part of the Bering Sea. The size-age and weight characteristics, features of the linear and weight growth, and period, scale, and conditions of spawning and feeding have been analyzed for Walleye pollock, polar cod, saffron cod Eleginus gracilis, and Pacific cod G. macrocephalus. The biological parameters of the fishes from the Chukchi and Bering seas have been compared. It is noted that saffron cod and Pacific cod in the study area are represented mainly by juveniles and immature individuals. In addition to juveniles, a significant number of individuals with a length of over 50 cm at age ≥7 years have been recorded among Walleye pollock individuals in 2018–2020. Polar cod from the Chukchi shelf differed in a smaller body size than polar cod from the northwestern part of the Bering Sea.},

In 2017, we conducted a study as part of the Arctic Integrated Ecosystem Research Program to characterize the distribution, abundance, and growth of polar cod and saffron cod early life history stages (ELHS) in late spring and late summer in the Chukchi Sea. Ship-based plankton tows showed that polar cod and saffron cod larvae were centered in Kotzebue Sound in the late spring. By late summer, polar cod juveniles were most abundant in the offshore areas of the northern Chukchi Sea, whereas saffron cod were distributed nearshore in the southern Chukchi Sea around Cape Lisburne. Empirical fish collections were paired with an individual-based biophysical transport model to examine connectivity and relate changes in seasonal distribution to potential environmental variables. Modeled drift trajectories and growth in spring for polar cod and saffron cod matched well with empirical observations, especially along the northern coastline of Kotzebue Sound, offshore of Point Hope/Cape Lisburne. Given the coherence between modeled and observed distributions, Kotzebue Sound is likely a source of gadid ELHS in the nearshore areas of the Chukchi Sea and offshore of Cape Lisburne/Point Hope, although it is not the likely source of polar cod over Hanna Shoal in the late summer. This is the first study to examine seasonal distribution, abundance, and growth of polar cod and saffron cod in the US Arctic and provides data necessary to evaluate the impacts of climate change on forage fishes in the Arctic.},

We assessed potential changes by modelling the prey base of a widely distributed Arctic predator (ringed seal; Pusa hispida) in a sentinel area for change (Hudson Bay) under high- and low-greenhouse gas emission scenarios from 1950 to 2100. All changes were relatively negligible under the low-emission scenario, but under the high-emission scenario, we projected a 50\% decline in the abundance of the well-distributed, ice-adapted and energy-rich Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and an increase in the abundance of smaller temperate-associated fish in southern and coastal areas. Furthermore, our model predicted that all fish species declined in mean body size, but a 29\% increase in total prey biomass. Declines in energy-rich prey and restrictions in their spatial range are likely to have cascading effects on Arctic predators.},

This investigation is the first to include data for the 2006–2010 cold period and to use between-year comparisons of local and shelf-wide spatial indices to test specific responses to three different isothermal boundaries within the cold pool. Distributional shifts in population varied considerably among species and directional vectors for some species were greater in magnitude to the east or west than to the north or south; however, in general, eastern Bering Sea shelf populations shifted southward in response to the increasing cold pool size, and after accounting for differences in temperature and population abundance, there was still a temporal northward shift in populations over the last three decades despite the recent cooling trend. Model results for local and shelf-wide indices showed that survey time lag and cold pool extent had a greater effect on spatial distribution than population abundance, suggesting that density-independent mechanisms play a major role in shaping distribution patterns on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The area enclosed by the 1°C isotherm most commonly affects both local and shelf-wide spatial indices suggesting that 1°C is a more important boundary for describing temperature preferences of eastern Bering Sea bottom fishes and crabs than is the 2°C isotherm used for designating the physical boundary for the cold pool.}

abstract = {Selectivity studies have found applications in a wide range of topics within fishery science, such as fishery management, stock assessment, and ecological process studies. However, obtaining selectivity functions can often be a difficult and costly endeavor. Because of this difficulty, many studies are limited to the comparison of catch from two fishing gears, where relative differences in catch efficiency are often presented in the form of catch comparison rate or catch ratio. Studies of these rates are well known to often improve commercial fisheries, which benefit from highly selective gears. However, utility of these statistics for the purposes of fisheries surveys and stock assessment is not very well understood. In this study we adapted methods previously used for catch ratio to obtain length-dependent selectivity ratio function for two survey gears. Selectivity ratio can be obtained when area-swept or volume-swept fish density estimates are available from both gears. In other cases it is possible to obtain relative selectivity ratio. We present a general approach to obtain selectivity ratio in survey gear comparison studies and model it using three alternative techniques (linear and smooth mixed effect, and beta-regression). We use crossvalidation to choose between alternative models. We present examples of practical application of selectivity ratio with three case studies: a comparison of fine-and large mesh bottom trawls used in Arctic surveys, a study testing an assumption of non-selectivity of the Nephrops bottom trawl for snow crab in the Bering Sea, and a comparison of two survey midwater trawls for pollock in the Bering Sea. We show that selectivity ratio statistics can be used as a generalization of selectivity studies, where one gear is non-selective, as well as in catch comparison studies where selectivity of both gears is unknown.}

Poleward shifts may represent a homogeneous shift in distribution, seasonal northward movement of specific populations, or colonization processes at the poleward edge of the distribution. The ecosystem of the Bering Sea has been changing along with the climate, moving from an arctic to a subarctic system. Several fish species have been observed farther north than previously reported and in increasing abundances. We examined one of these fish species, Pacific cod, in the northern Bering Sea (NBS) to assess whether they migrated from another stock in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), Gulf of Alaska, or Aleutian Islands, or whether they represent a separate population. Genetic analyses using 3,599 single nucleotide polymorphism markers indicated that nonspawning cod collected in August 2017 in the NBS were similar to spawning stocks of cod in the EBS. This result suggests escalating northward movement of the large EBS stock during summer months. Whether the cod observed in the NBS migrate south during winter to spawn or remain in the NBS as a sink population is unknown.},

   abstract = {The climate regime in the eastern Bering Sea has recently been dominated by a pattern of multi-year stanzas, in which several successive years of minimal sea-ice formation and warm summer temperatures (e.g., 2002–2005, 2014–2017) alternate with several years of relatively extensive sea-ice formation and cold summer temperatures (e.g., 2006–2013). This emerging climate pattern may be forcing long-term changes in the spatial distributions of the Bering Sea’s marine fauna. The National Marine Fisheries Service’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center recently conducted two bottom trawl surveys covering the entire Bering Sea shelf from the Alaska Peninsula to the Bering Strait. The first, in the summer of 2010, was conducted during a cold year when the majority of the continental shelf was covered by a pool of cold (< 2 °C) water. The second, in the summer of 2017, was during a warmer year with water temperatures above the long-term survey mean. These two surveys recorded significantly different spatial distributions for populations of several commercially important fish species, including walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and several flatfish species, as well as jellyfishes. Population shifts included latitudinal displacement as well as variable recruitment success. The large-scale distributional shifts reported here for high-biomass species raise questions about long-term ecosystem impacts, and highlight the need for continued monitoring. They also raise questions about our management strategies for these and other species in Alaska’s large marine ecosystems.},

   abstract = {In designing and performing surveys of animal abundance, monitoring programs often struggle to determine the sampling intensity and design required to achieve their objectives, and this problem greatly increases in complexity for multispecies surveys with inherent trade-offs among species. To address these issues, we conducted a multispecies stratified random survey design optimization using a spatiotemporal operating model and a genetic algorithm that optimizes both the stratification (defined by depth and longitude) and the minimum optimal allocation of samples across strata subject to prespecified precision limits. Surveys were then simulated under those optimized designs and performance was evaluated by calculating the precision and accuracy of a resulting design-based abundance index. We applied this framework to a multispecies fishery-independent bottom trawl survey in the Gulf of Alaska, USA. Incorporating only spatial variation in the optimization failed to produce population estimates within the prespecified precision constraints, whereas including additional spatiotemporal variation ensured that estimates were both unbiased and within prespecified precision constraints. In general, results were not sensitive to the number of strata in the optimized solutions. This optimization approach provides an objective quantitative framework for designing new, or improving existing, survey designs for many different ecosystems.},

abstract = {Arctic sea-ice extent and volume are declining rapidly. Several studies project that the Arctic Ocean may become seasonally ice-free by the year 2040 or even earlier. Putting this into perspective requires information on the history of Arctic sea-ice conditions through the geologic past. This information can be provided by proxy records from the Arctic Ocean floor and from the surrounding coasts. Although existing records are far from complete, they indicate that sea ice became a feature of the Arctic by 47Ma, following a pronounced decline in atmospheric pCO2 after the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Optimum, and consistently covered at least part of the Arctic Ocean for no less than the last 13–14 million years. Ice was apparently most widespread during the last 2–3 million years, in accordance with Earth's overall cooler climate. Nevertheless, episodes of considerably reduced sea ice or even seasonally ice-free conditions occurred during warmer periods linked to orbital variations. The last low-ice event related to orbital forcing (high insolation) was in the early Holocene, after which the northern high latitudes cooled overall, with some superimposed shorter-term (multidecadal to millennial-scale) and lower-magnitude variability. The current reduction in Arctic ice cover started in the late 19th century, consistent with the rapidly warming climate, and became very pronounced over the last three decades. This ice loss appears to be unmatched over at least the last few thousand years and unexplainable by any of the known natural variabilities.}

Sea-ice loss emerges as an important driver of marine and terrestrial ecological dynamics, influencing productivity, species interactions, population mixing, gene flow, and pathogen and disease transmission. Major challenges in the near future include assigning clearer attribution to sea ice as a primary driver of such dynamics, especially in terrestrial systems, and addressing pressures arising from human use of arctic coastal and near-shore areas as sea ice diminishes.}}

Preconditioning through decades of overall ice reductions made the ice pack more vulnerable to a strong storm that entered the central Arctic in early August 2012. The storm caused the separation of an expanse of 0.4 × 106 km2 of ice that melted in total, while its removal left the main pack more exposed to wind and waves, facilitating the main pack's further decay. Future summer storms could lead to a further acceleration of the decline in the Arctic sea ice cover and should be carefully monitored.}

abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest (“derived quantities”) are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional “plug-in” estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new “epsilon” estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.}

abstract = {We used genetic techniques to identify gadids (cods) to species in the Pacific Arctic during a time of substantial physical change in the marine ecosystem between 2012 and 2019. The dominant fish species in the Chukchi Sea is Arctic Cod (Boreogadus saida); however, other gadids such as Saffron Cod (Eleginus gracilis), Pacific Cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and Walleye Pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) have been observed. Two aims in this study were to evaluate the accuracy of at sea morphological identification (which can be difficult for juveniles) with genetic species identification and to document potential variation in species composition and distribution of gadids in the Pacific Arctic in response to changing environmental conditions. Microsatellite and mtDNA genetic results revealed that most B. saida collected in the Chukchi Sea in 2012 and 2013 were correctly identified at sea. Conversely, genetic results from samples collected in 2017 and 2019 revealed a large number of G. chalcogrammus and some G. macrocephalus and E. gracilis that were initially identified at sea as B. saida. The majority of misidentification occurred between B. saida and G. chalcogrammus. This study indicates a northward shift of G. chalcogrammus and B. saida during warmer conditions. In addition, juvenile Polar Cod (A. glacialis), which is not typically found in the Chukchi Sea and was not identified at sea, was genetically detected on 3 hauls on the northern Chukchi Shelf, outside of its documented distribution. Accurate species identification, especially during a time of changing marine landscapes, is not only important for survey abundance estimates but for downstream analyses as well. This emphasizes the value of implementing strategies for correct identification of the gadid species to better capture and monitor responses to varying and likely changing conditions. Our results provide strong evidence of distributional shifts and range expansions of gadid species in the Arctic, which may be the result of changing climactic conditions.}
