   abstract = {Presented here are data on the size composition and age structure, the sex ratio, the state of maturity of the gonads, and the composition of the diet and feeding habits of walleye pollock in the western Chukchi Sea, based on 2003-2020 bottom and mid-water trawl surveys conducted onboard Russian research vessels. During all years of research, mid-water trawl catches in this area were dominated by juveniles with FL 5–12 cm, while the size composition of walleye pollock in bottom trawl catches was bimodal with the dominance of fish 7–14 cm and 50–62 cm long. Females were considerably larger than males (on average by almost 10 cm), with mean FL 56.0–58.3 cm and 52.1–56.4 cm, respectively, in different years. The age structure of walleye pollock was significantly different from that of both the western and eastern Bering Sea since fingerlings and yearlings predominated there in the mid-water trawl catches, and fish under the age of 1 year and 6–17 years were the most numerous in the bottom trawl catches. In the western Chukchi Sea in 2018–2020, the proportion of females in bottom trawl catches ranged from 1.8 to 2.7 females per male. This is probably because walleye pollock here were represented mainly by large fish, while in the mature part of the population, females are usually larger than males. The proportion of fish with gonads at different stages of maturity varied significantly in different years. Immature individuals were extremely few among the fish analyzed. Individuals with developing and post-spawning gonads accounted for a major part of the catches. In recent years, walleye pollock of both sexes have been observed in pre-spawning, spawning, and post-spawning condition, which may indicate the possibility of spawning of individual specimens in the western Chukchi Sea. The survival of eggs, larvae, and fry in conditions of low temperatures is unlikely. However, if the warming in the Arctic continues, it is possible that new walleye pollock spawning grounds may appear in the Chukchi Sea. In the western Chukchi Sea, the proportion of euphausiids in the diet of large walleye pollock (>40 cm in 2018 and > 60 cm in 2019) was significantly higher than that of small fish (<40 cm). In the average long-term plan, the decrease in its diet with the growth was characteristic only for planktonic organisms (small crustaceans, chaetognaths, and larvaceans). Only large benthic crustaceans showed an increase in the walleye pollock diet as it grew. There were no pronounced trends regarding euphausiids and fish. In the western Chukchi Sea, the cannibalism was registered only in large individuals (40–60 cm and >60 cm) and only in 2019 with small number juveniles consumed. Such a low level of cannibalism was probably due to the spatial separation of juveniles and adults, as well as the presence of a sufficient amount of other prey.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Based on the results of research in 1995–2020, mass and potentially commercial fish species have been identified in Russian waters of the Chukchi Sea. Among the 72 species recorded in trawl catches, 16 species from six families were mass species; fishes of the cod family (Gadidae) were absolutely dominant among them (on average, 92.6% of the total commercial biomass of marine fishes). In the late 1990s–early 2000s, the stocks of this family were represented mainly by polar cod Boreogadus saida. In the late 2010s, its biomass significantly decreased; however, the stocks of Walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) significantly increased as a result of its migrations from the northern part of the Bering Sea. The size-age and weight characteristics, features of the linear and weight growth, and period, scale, and conditions of spawning and feeding have been analyzed for Walleye pollock, polar cod, saffron cod Eleginus gracilis, and Pacific cod G. macrocephalus. The biological parameters of the fishes from the Chukchi and Bering seas have been compared. It is noted that saffron cod and Pacific cod in the study area are represented mainly by juveniles and immature individuals. In addition to juveniles, a significant number of individuals with a length of over 50 cm at age ≥7 years have been recorded among Walleye pollock individuals in 2018–2020. Polar cod from the Chukchi shelf differed in a smaller body size than polar cod from the northwestern part of the Bering Sea.},

   abstract = {Poleward species range shifts have been predicted to result from climate change, and many observations have confirmed such movement. Poleward shifts may represent a homogeneous shift in distribution, seasonal northward movement of specific populations, or colonization processes at the poleward edge of the distribution. The ecosystem of the Bering Sea has been changing along with the climate, moving from an arctic to a subarctic system. Several fish species have been observed farther north than previously reported and in increasing abundances. We examined one of these fish species, Pacific cod, in the northern Bering Sea (NBS) to assess whether they migrated from another stock in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), Gulf of Alaska, or Aleutian Islands, or whether they represent a separate population. Genetic analyses using 3,599 single nucleotide polymorphism markers indicated that nonspawning cod collected in August 2017 in the NBS were similar to spawning stocks of cod in the EBS. This result suggests escalating northward movement of the large EBS stock during summer months. Whether the cod observed in the NBS migrate south during winter to spawn or remain in the NBS as a sink population is unknown.},

   abstract = {The climate regime in the eastern Bering Sea has recently been dominated by a pattern of multi-year stanzas, in which several successive years of minimal sea-ice formation and warm summer temperatures (e.g., 2002–2005, 2014–2017) alternate with several years of relatively extensive sea-ice formation and cold summer temperatures (e.g., 2006–2013). This emerging climate pattern may be forcing long-term changes in the spatial distributions of the Bering Sea’s marine fauna. The National Marine Fisheries Service’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center recently conducted two bottom trawl surveys covering the entire Bering Sea shelf from the Alaska Peninsula to the Bering Strait. The first, in the summer of 2010, was conducted during a cold year when the majority of the continental shelf was covered by a pool of cold (< 2 °C) water. The second, in the summer of 2017, was during a warmer year with water temperatures above the long-term survey mean. These two surveys recorded significantly different spatial distributions for populations of several commercially important fish species, including walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and several flatfish species, as well as jellyfishes. Population shifts included latitudinal displacement as well as variable recruitment success. The large-scale distributional shifts reported here for high-biomass species raise questions about long-term ecosystem impacts, and highlight the need for continued monitoring. They also raise questions about our management strategies for these and other species in Alaska’s large marine ecosystems.},

   abstract = {In designing and performing surveys of animal abundance, monitoring programs often struggle to determine the sampling intensity and design required to achieve their objectives, and this problem greatly increases in complexity for multispecies surveys with inherent trade-offs among species. To address these issues, we conducted a multispecies stratified random survey design optimization using a spatiotemporal operating model and a genetic algorithm that optimizes both the stratification (defined by depth and longitude) and the minimum optimal allocation of samples across strata subject to prespecified precision limits. Surveys were then simulated under those optimized designs and performance was evaluated by calculating the precision and accuracy of a resulting design-based abundance index. We applied this framework to a multispecies fishery-independent bottom trawl survey in the Gulf of Alaska, USA. Incorporating only spatial variation in the optimization failed to produce population estimates within the prespecified precision constraints, whereas including additional spatiotemporal variation ensured that estimates were both unbiased and within prespecified precision constraints. In general, results were not sensitive to the number of strata in the optimized solutions. This optimization approach provides an objective quantitative framework for designing new, or improving existing, survey designs for many different ecosystems.},
