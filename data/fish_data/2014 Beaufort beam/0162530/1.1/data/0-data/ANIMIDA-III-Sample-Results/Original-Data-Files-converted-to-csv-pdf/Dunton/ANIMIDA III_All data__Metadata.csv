Sample info for ANIMIDA III Cruises (Jul/Aug 2014 and Aug 2015),
Data compiled by Carrie Harris (carolynn.harris@utexas.edu) in March 2016,
,
Isotopes Tab,
"Contains isotope data for all samples that have been PROCESSED for stable isotope analysis. Hundreds more samples were collected that have not been processed, and are therefore NOT included here.",
"Unique ID = sample ID assigned by UTMSI for isotope processing, samples with two numbers have been split into two subsamples, one subsample was acidified and used for d13C analysis and one subsample was NOT acidified and used for d15N analysis.",
,"For POM samples, two unique IDs (ie. 13+15) means that 2 reps were combined to have enough mass for one isotope sample"
"Type = sed (sediment), POM (particulate organic matter collected on GFF filter from CTD water), Phy (phytoplankton collected on GFF filter from 20um net), Zoop (zooplankton collected from 325um net, sometimes on filter), animal (critters from grab and trawl samples)",
Composit = number of individual organisms combined to form a single isotope sample,
"Acidified? = indicates if sample was run as one non-acidified sample (non only), one acidified sample (acid only), or run as a pair of subsamples (acid - non)",
,
,
Sed Chemistry Tab,
"Contains ammonium, salinity, and total chl a concentration information for sediment samples collected from Van veen grab using a 15ml syringe core (2cc collected)  (pigment) and a 60ml syringe core (NH4)",
Salinity was also measured on NH4 sediment samples,
,
,
Sed Pigments Tab,
Contains pigment concentration information for sediment samples collected from Van veen grab using a 15ml syringe core (2cc collected)  (pigment) and a 60ml syringe core (NH4),
"Concentration for 12 pigments listed, the chl a data from this tab is also listed in the Sed Chemistry Tab",
