1,Collected via amphipod trap.,
2,Collected via beam trawl.,
3,Collected via clam rake.,
7,"Dissected tissue samples were prepared from biota collected using benthic trawls, traps and van Veen grabs",
10,Sampled from the sea floor using a double Van Veen grab.  The samples were stored in an access-limited freezer until sample preparation could begin.,
11,Analyzed from 1-cm or 2-cm layers of sediment taken from the sea floor by a 7-cm diameter gravity core.,
12,Analyzed from top 1-cm of surficial sample taken from the sea floor using a 0.1 m^2 Van Veen grab.,
13,Sampled from the sea floor using a sediment corer.  The samples were stored in an access-limited freezer until sample preparation could begin.,
14,Collected via amphipod trap.  The samples were stored in an access-limited freezer until sample preparation could begin.,
15,Collected via beam trawl.  The samples were stored in an access-limited freezer until sample preparation could begin.,
16,Collected via clam rake.  The samples were stored in an access-limited freezer until sample preparation could begin.,
17,"Dissected tissue samples were prepared from biota collected using benthic trawls, rakes, and Van Veen grabs",
18,Particulate organic matter collected on GFF filter from seawater sample obtained via CTD rosette sampler,
19,Phytoplankton collected on GFF filter from 20-micron phytoplankton net,
20,Surficial sediment sample taken from the sea floor using Van Veen grab,
21,Surficial sediment sample was taken from the sea floor using a Van Veen grab. A subsample for analysis was collected using a 15 mL syringe core (2 cc collected).,
22,Surficial sediment sample was taken from the sea floor using a Van Veen grab. A subsample for analysis was collected using a 60 mL syringe core.,
23,"Zooplankton collected with a 325-micron zooplankton net, sometimes on filter",
26,"Seawater sample collected in a 5-L Niskin bottle mounted on a rosette sampler, then filtered to obtain dissolved and particulate samples for trace metal analysis.",
30,Peristalic pump through the sea ice,
31,Peristalic pump through the sea ice or wading in with sample bottle from river bank,
32,Wading into the river with sample bottle(s) from the river bank,
34,Measured with a Seabird SBE 19plus V2 SeaCAT CTD that was hand deployed on a line through a 10-inch hole drilled in the ice canopy.,
36,"Epibenthos were sampled from a modified 3-m plumb-staff beam trawl with 7 mm mesh and 4 mm cod end liner and bottom roller gear. Start and end time stamps of the bottom trawling were taken to later be matched with latitude and longitudes from the ship records. The net was also affixed with a time-depth recorder (TDR, Star Oddi) that provides a  profile of bottom time of the trawl. The coordinates and TDR data together with ship speed during towing were used to calculate towed area and calculate catch per unit effort (CPUE).",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064509002495
37,"Fishes were sampled from a modified 3-m plumb-staff beam trawl with 7 mm mesh and 4 mm cod end liner and bottom roller gear.

The net was also affixed with a time-depth recorder (TDR, Star Oddi) that provides a  profile of bottom time of the trawl. The coordinates and TDR data together with ship speed during towing were used to calculate towed area and calculate catch per unit effort (CPUE) for  fishes.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064509002495
39,"Samples were collected with a double van Veen grab (0.1 m^2), sieved through 0.1 mm screening, sorted and preserved in 80% ethanol. Three replicate samples were taken per station.",
41,Nutrient samples were collected in 50 mL polyethylene bottles. Bottles were triple rinsed with seawater before the sample was collected. Samples were immediately frozen for later processing at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.,
