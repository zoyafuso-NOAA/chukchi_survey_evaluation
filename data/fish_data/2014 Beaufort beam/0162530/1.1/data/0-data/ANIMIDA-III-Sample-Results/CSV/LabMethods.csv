Samples were prepared for analysis by weighing approximately 30 grams of sample material into a pre-cleaned extraction vessel and dried using sodium sulfate.  Each sample was spiked with PAH, Biomarker and SHC surrogates and extracted 3 times using methylene chloride by shaker table.  The combined extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated by Kuderna-Danish (KD) and nitrogen evaporation techniques.  Sample clean-up was performed on the extracts using alumina columns. Extracts were further cleaned up and fractionated using silica gel columns. The F1 fraction was collected and split for TPH/SHC and biomarker analyses. The F2 fraction was collected for PAH and alkyated PAH analysis. The extracts were concentrated and spiked with IS for analysis.  TPH/SHC was measured by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC/FID). An initial calibration consisting of target analytes was completed prior to analysis to demonstrate the linear range of analysis. Calibration verification was performed at the beginning and end of each 24 hour period (or 10 samples) in which samples were analyzed. Concentrations of TPH/SHC were calculated by the internal standard method. Normal alkanes were quantified using the average RF generated from the initial calibration. TPH concentrations were quantified using the average RF of nC9 through nC40.  All data are reported as surrogate corrected versus dry wt.  The NSC and CO are reported as not surrogate corrected versus oil weight.",
