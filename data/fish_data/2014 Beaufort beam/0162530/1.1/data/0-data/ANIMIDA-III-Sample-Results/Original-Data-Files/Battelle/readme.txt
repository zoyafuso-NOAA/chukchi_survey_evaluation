Battelle’s hydrocarbon (and methylmercury) chemistry data for the samples collected during the 2014-5 field survey (and data for some sediment core samples collected in 2014).  

Filename begins with the year, e.g., S14 for 2015, S15 for 2015.

Filenames with COCs are known as "chain of custody" files by Battelle. They link sample IDs to sampling stations.

Priority Pollutant PAH are the 16 EPA PP PAH.
Sum SHC is the sum of the concentrations of the individual SHC compounds, and SHC Total is a single unresolved+resolved SHC integration and quantitation (identical to a TPH analysis). In other words, SHC Total is the total amount of saturated hydrocarbons, including those which they could not or did not identify individually.

The Word document QC narratives provide brief method summaries, and the two methods are GCMS (which includes both the PAH class of compounds and the BIOMARKER class of compounds) and GCFID (for SHC/alkanes).
